# Csharp_Students_Management

## Project Overview:

Welcome to ZGB Students Management Tool!

ZGB Students Management Tool is a C# WinForms application built on the .NET Framework which serves as the main tech-hub for the daily activities of a fictive educational institution from Romania.

It supports three main user roles:
	— Students
	- Teachers
	- Secretary 

It also empower each one with tailored tools to manage courses, notes, files, important announcements and other features.

## Business Context:
The ZGB Students Management Tool is developed for "Colegiul Tehnic ZGB, a mid-sized educational institution in Romania with approximately __800 students and 50 staff members__.

The school has been facing challenges in efficiently managing course materials, tracking student progress, and communicating important updates to different stakeholders.

Currently, the processes are fragmented:

Teachers store course files in personal folders with no centralized access

Students receive announcements through multiple channels (paper notes, social media groups, word-of-mouth), leading to missed deadlines

The secretary handles administrative requests via phone or in-person visits, often causing delays

The goal of this application is to centralize information and improve communication by offering a single, user-friendly platform accessible from any school computer.
